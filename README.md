# StudentData
The CRUD Student Management system uses Spring Boot with MySQL/MongoDB. It follows MVC architecture with models for student data, repositories for database access, services for business logic, and controllers for API endpoints. Spring Security ensures secure access. The system supports operations to view, register, edit, and delete students.
